# ETHOnline 2021 Hackathon

For the ETHOnline 2021 Hackathon we develop a laye 2 alpha strategy in the form of a yield optimization engine running on layer 2 connecting different layer 2 systems together. Specifically, we focus in this hack on optimizing LPing in Curve pools on Polygon and Arbitrum.

## Developers

Rename the config.cfg.example into "config.cfg", then put your moralis ID and run the various `stepX<...>.py` scripts one after the other and change inputs as needed.

Reach out to Jesper on our Discord server at https://discord.gg/mC86ZysZ if you get stuck!

# What is Composable Finance?

Link: https://www.composable.finance/

Composable Finance is a cross-chain and cross-layer interoperability platform. It serves as a hyper-liquidity infrastructure layer for DeFi assets, powered by Layer 2 Ethereum and Polkadot.

The lack of interoperability between multiple blockchains and layers creates fragmentation and disparity in the ecosystem. Developers are very restricted in what they can build with siloed infrastructures, and users are forced to navigate complicated and lengthy processes if they want to utilize multiple chains or layers.
Composable Finance is working on a suite of different products to establish cross-chain and cross-layer interoperability that will reduce the barriers for DeFi developers and remove the unnecessary complexity for the users.
Our development roadmap has two phases. In the first phase, we will focus on multi-layer (L2/L2) interoperability, bridging the gap between different Ethereum Layer 2 implementations and sidechains. In the second phase, we will launch our parachain, Picasso. It has been developed over several months to enable a complete DeFi ecosystem on Polkadot. This will be accomplished through a parachain with built-in, customizable pallets for each of the key DeFi primitives as well as those more advanced secondary and tertiary features, enabling the development of seamless, interoperable dApps.
